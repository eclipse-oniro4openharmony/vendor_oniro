# Roll back the commits created by do_patch.sh, driven by the
# .patch_state file it wrote (repo<TAB>pre_sha<TAB>post_sha per line).
#
# For each repo this verifies, BEFORE touching anything, that:
#   * the working tree is clean (reset --hard would discard dirty work);
#   * HEAD still equals the recorded post-patch SHA (i.e. nothing was
#     committed or amended on top since do_patch.sh ran).
# If any repo has diverged the script aborts without changing a thing.
# When all checks pass it resets each repo to its recorded pre-patch SHA.
